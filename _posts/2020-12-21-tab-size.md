*Jekyll's* default highlighter *Rouge* do not allow change `tab-size` for code samples. The only way seems to be changing *CSS* this way

1. check `page/_site/assets` to see what *CSS* file is used by your current jekyll theme (in my case it is `main.css`)

2. create `main.scss` file in `page/assets` directory (the name of the file is derived from step 1, but instead of `.css` we use `.scss` extension)

3. the content of `main.scss` should looks this way

```liquid

@import "minima";

pre {
	tab-size: 3;
	-moz-tab-size: 3;
}
```
