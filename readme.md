## usage instructions

The page is generated by Jekyll so before it can be use we need to install `ruby`, `ruby-dev` and `ruby-bundler` packages command

```bash
sudo apt install ruby ruby-dev ruby-bundler
```

then run

```bash
bundle install
```

to install required gems.

Run with

```bash
./serve
```

command and open `http://localhost:4000` in web browser window.

> **tip**: install bundler and jekyll with `gem install bundler jekyll` command
