# About
The repository is meant as my personal blog about development (mainly for *C++*).
The page is generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static side generator and is meant to be hosted on GIthub's pages ([sansajn.github.io](https://sansajn.github.io)). 

## usage instructions
Before we can install *Jekyll* itself we need `ruby`, `ruby-dev` and `ruby-bundler` packages. Run following command

```bash
sudo apt install ruby ruby-dev ruby-bundler
```

to install *Jekyll* dependencies, then run

```bash
bundle install
```

to install required gems (ruby dependencies).

> **note**: the bundle installer will ask for root password to install dependency gems

Run with

```bash
./serve
```

command and open `http://localhost:4000` in web browser window.
